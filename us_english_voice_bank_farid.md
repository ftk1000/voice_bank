**Creating a Voice Bank: A Step-by-Step Guide**

A **voice bank** is a digital repository of recorded speech samples used to create a synthetic voice that closely resembles your natural voice. This can be invaluable for individuals who may lose their ability to speak due to medical conditions like amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), throat cancer, or other speech-impairing illnesses. By banking your voice, you can maintain a personal and familiar means of communication through speech-generating devices or applications.

---

### **Why Create a Voice Bank?**

- **Personal Connection:** Retain your unique vocal identity even if you lose the ability to speak.
- **Emotional Well-being:** Communicate in a voice that feels like your own, which can be comforting for both you and your loved ones.
- **Future-Proofing:** Prepare for potential speech loss by securing your voice in advance.
